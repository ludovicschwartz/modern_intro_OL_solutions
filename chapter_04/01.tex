Prove that OSD in Example 4.11 with $ x_1 =0 $ is exactly the Follow-the-Leader strategy for that particular problem.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}[]
In example 4.11, we have $ \ell_t(x) = (x-y_t)^2$, $ \eta_t = \frac{1}{2t} $. We can explicitely compute the predictions of OSD :
\begin{equation*}
	x_1 =0
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{align*}
	x_{t+1} &= x_t - \eta_t \nabla \ell_t(x_t) \\
		&= x_t - \frac{1}{t}(x_t - y_t) \\
		&= \frac{t-1}{t}x_t + \frac{1}{t}
\end{align*}
An elementary induction then gives $ x_{t+1} = \frac{1}{t}\sum_{s=1}^{t}y_s $ which is exactly the strategy of Follow-the-Leader on that problem.
\end{solution}
