	Consider Projected Online Subgradient Descent for the example 2.10 on the failure of Follow-the-Leader: Can we use it on that problem ? Would it guarantee sublinear regret ? How would the behaviour of the algorithm differ from FTL ?
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}[]
	The setting of Example 2.10 is the following : Let $ V = [-1,1] $ and consider the sequence of losses $ \ell_t(x) = z_tx + i_v(x) $, where 
\begin{align*}
	z_t = 
\begin{cases}
	-0.5 &\text{ if } t=1\\
	(-1)^t &\text{ if } t>1
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
We can apply Projected Online Subgradient Descent in that problem. In particular, since we only do prediction inside of $ V $, we can consider the loss function $ \ell_t(x) = z_t x $. We have :
\begin{equation*}
	\nabla \ell_t(x) = z_t
\end{equation*}
Now we can verify that :
\begin{equation*}
	\forall x \in V, \norm{\nabla  \ell_t(x)} \leq 1:=L
\end{equation*}
and that :
\begin{equation*}
	D := \sup_{x,y\in V}\norm{x-y} = 2 < \infty
\end{equation*}
Theorem 2.13 applies and we get a bound of order $ DL\sqrt{T}= 2\sqrt{T} $, that is to say, sublinear regret. The main difference with Follow the Leader is that Projected Online Subgradient Decent will pick points in the interior of V and do small updates on them while Follow the leader picks extremal points and moves a lot between each prediction.

\end{solution}
